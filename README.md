Simple heist on the aircraft carrier for the framework vrp.

You WILL need to edit some of this yourself, in the server script where it says "print("ready") -- just a place holder, add an event here for whatever notification system etc you use", you need to do what it says.

Every 3600 seconds (configurable in the config), players will be notified about a shipment on the aircraft carrier. They need to go to the carrier, fight off a wave of armed military personnel, hack a computer to find where the package is on the carrier (takes about a minute), then has to go pick up the package while fighting off another wave of armed military personnel. The PEDS are not intended to really kill you, more of a distraction to allow other players to go to the carrier and fight you for the package.

This is one of my first vrp releases (making the switch from ESX), hence why vrp usage is very minimal, i only use it in the server script to add money to the bank account and that is it.

You can easily change the reward in the config, it comes setup to give meth, cocaine, and heroine, as long as that is what you have your items id's as.
